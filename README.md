# Handling-Skewed-Data

Data can be handled by following ways:

1. Log Transform
2. Box Cox Transform
3. Square Root Transform


What is Data Skewness?
Data Skewness is asymmetry in a statistical distribution, in which the curve appears distorted or skewed either to the left or to the right. 
In a skewed distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all different values.

Normal Distribution
In a normal distribution, the graph appears as a classical, symmetrical “bell-shaped curve.” The mean, or average, and the mode, or maximum point on the curve, are equal.
